# Coupon Acceptance Rate Analysis

This project investigates coupon acceptance rates among various demographic groups and how different factors such as weather, destination, and marital status influence the likelihood of using coupons.

## Data Cleaning
- The `Car` column had a significant number of `NaN` values, which were replaced with `1` to represent individuals with cars. 
- Columns with few `NaN` values were removed to maintain data integrity.
